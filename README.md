### Disaggregated forecast models for anomaly detection applied to business outcomes. 2023


The "store-level-forecast" research is focused on developing forecasting models for anomaly detection applied to business outcomes. The objective is to identify when forecasted sales diverge significantly from actual sales, in order to identify anomalies in business performance. The research will use different forecasting methods, including the Theta Model, LSTM, and Holt-Winters, to forecast short periods of less than a year across various segments of an organization. The research aims to develop a systematic method for forecasting different segments, determine the most suitable forecasting methodology, evaluate various model parameters and hyper-parameters, and implement a notification system to alert decision-makers of significant deviations in the expected forecast.

The research aims to help organizations in identifying potential issues and taking timely action to address them, thereby enhancing their chances of success in achieving business objectives. By providing organizations with insights, forecasting allows them to adapt their strategies and make changes, such as hiring additional staff or increasing production, in order to improve their chances of success. The research will be beneficial for organizations looking to improve their forecasting capabilities and proactively address business issues.

Overall, the "store-level-forecast" research aims to provide organizations with a more effective way of forecasting business outcomes and detecting anomalies. By identifying potential issues in advance, decision-makers can take timely action to address them and achieve their business objectives.
